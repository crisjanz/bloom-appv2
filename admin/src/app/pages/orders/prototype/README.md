# Take Order Prototype - New UX Experience

## 📍 Access the Prototype

Navigate to: **http://localhost:5174/orders/prototype**

Or click this link from your app navigation (you may want to add a menu link temporarily).

## 🎯 What is This?

This is a **fully functional UI/UX prototype** of the new stepwise order flow. It demonstrates:

- ✅ Progressive disclosure (step-by-step flow)
- ✅ Sticky right-side summary panel
- ✅ Smart navigation with conditional logic
- ✅ Real-time summary updates
- ✅ Edit functionality from summary
- ✅ All form validation
- ✅ Multi-section order building

**Important**: This is a **pure UX demo** - no data is saved to the database!

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Main Components

1. **TakeOrderPrototypePage.tsx** - Main container with state management
2. **StepperNavigation.tsx** - Top stepper bar with progress indicator
3. **OrderSummaryPanel.tsx** - Sticky right-side summary
4. **CustomerSection.tsx** - Step 1: Customer & Order Type
5. **RecipientSection.tsx** - Step 2: Recipient Information
6. **DeliverySection.tsx** - Step 3: Delivery & Message
7. **ProductsSection.tsx** - Step 4: Products
8. **PaymentSection.tsx** - Step 5: Review & Payment

### State Management

All order data is managed in local React state:
```typescript
interface OrderPrototypeState {
  customer: {...}
  orderType: "PHONE" | "WALKIN" | "WIREIN"
  orderMethod: "DELIVERY" | "PICKUP"
  recipient: {...}
  delivery: {...}
  products: [...]
  payment: {...}
}
```
