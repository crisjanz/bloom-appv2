## Notes for Template Users

**When creating a new quick guide:**

1. **Keep it simple:**
   - Use plain language (avoid: "execute", "SSH", "environment variables")
   - Use familiar terms (prefer: "run", "connect", "settings")
   - Max 1 page of content (excluding troubleshooting)

2. **Structure:**
   - Start with "When to use" (symptoms/triggers)
   - List prerequisites clearly
   - Number steps sequentially (no sub-steps)
   - Include copy-paste commands in code blocks
   - End with verification

3. **Writing style:**
   - Imperative mood: "Click the button" not "You should click"
   - Active voice: "Open Terminal" not "Terminal should be opened"
   - Present tense: "Chrome opens" not "Chrome will open"

4. **Visual aids:**
   - Add screenshot placeholders: `*(Screenshot: description)*`
   - Include example outputs in code blocks
   - Use **bold** for UI elements: "Click the **Save** button"

5. **Troubleshooting:**
   - List 3-5 most common issues
   - Keep solutions 1-2 lines max
   - Link to technical guide for complex issues

6. **Testing:**
   - Have a non-technical person test the guide
   - Watch them follow it without your help
   - Note where they get confused
   - Simplify those sections
