# Codex Instructions

- On session start, read `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root.
- Follow all instructions in `CLAUDE.md` EXCEPT any guidance about token/cost saving or minimizing context.
- Concretely, ignore the entire "Cost Optimization - CRITICAL" section and any directives that exist only to reduce token usage.
- If there is a conflict, `CLAUDE.md` wins for everything except token/cost-saving guidance.
- If `CLAUDE.md` is missing or unreadable, tell the user and proceed with best effort.
