# Bloom App Development Tracker

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive flower delivery and POS system with unified discount management, product variants, and order processing capabilities.

##  Completed Features

### Unified Discount System (Phase 1-4)
- **Database Schema**: Complete unified Discount model replacing separate coupon/product discount systems
- **Backend API**: Full CRUD operations for discounts with validation and auto-apply endpoints
- **Frontend Interface**: TailAdmin-compliant discount manager with progressive disclosure UI
- **Discount Types**: $ OFF, % OFF, Free Delivery, Sale Price, Buy X Get Y Free
- **Application Methods**: Coupon Code vs Auto-apply with product/category selection
- **Multi-Selection**: Tag-based UI for selecting multiple products and categories
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Removed all coupon-related links, imports, and pages

### Product Variant System
- **POS Integration**: Variant selection modal working in POS when adding products to cart
- **Backend API**: Product search endpoint returns full variant data with calculated prices
- **TakeOrder Integration**: Variant selection working in TakeOrder with proper price display
- **Price Calculations**: Fixed double conversion issues, proper cents-to-dollars handling

### TakeOrder System Enhancements
- **Product Search**: Fixed to include variant data from backend API
- **Variant Selection**: Modal appears when products have multiple variants
- **Automatic Discounts**: Implemented auto-discount checking when products added to cart
- **Manual Coupons**: Integrated with unified discount validation system
- **Product ID Storage**: Fixed to store actual product IDs for discount matching

### POS System Improvements
- **Discount Integration**: Uses unified discount system for both manual and automatic discounts
- **Variant Support**: Product variant modal working with calculated prices
- **Cart Updates**: Automatic discount checking when items added/removed

## <¯ Current Status
All major systems are operational:
-  Product variants work in both POS and TakeOrder
-  Manual coupon codes work (e.g., "BLOOM20")
-  Automatic discounts work (e.g., "20forU")
-  Unified discount system across all interfaces
-  Default variant pricing fixed in TakeOrder

## =Ë Key Technical Implementations

### Backend Updates
- `/api/products/search` - Now returns variant data with calculated prices
- `/api/discounts/*` - Complete unified discount API endpoints
- Product variant price calculations (stores differences, calculates on demand)

### Frontend Updates
- `ProductVariantModal` - Works in both POS and TakeOrder contexts
- `CreateDiscountModal` - Progressive disclosure UI with multi-select capabilities
- `PaymentCard` - Displays automatic discounts as blue boxes
- `ProductsCard` - Stores product IDs for discount matching

### Data Flow
1. Product search returns variants with calculated prices
2. Adding products stores actual product IDs
3. Automatic discount checking uses product IDs to match eligibility
4. Discounts display in color-coded sections (green=coupons, blue=auto/gift cards)

## =' Commands & Testing
- Backend: `npm run dev:back` (runs on port 4000)
- Frontend: `npm run dev` (runs on port 3000)
- Test automatic discounts: Add "Pretty in Purple" or "Victorian Garden" 
- Test variants: Search for "Victorian Garden" in TakeOrder
- Test coupons: Use code "BLOOM20" for 20% off

## =Á Key Files Modified
- `/back/src/routes/products.ts` - Added variant data to search endpoint
